# uc2bc

Sometimes it might be beneficial to redistribute unicast UDP traffic to multiple other clients. This program provides a solution to this problem. It listens on a specified UDP port on all local addresses and resends those packets to the local broadcast address. To avoid creating a loop the incoming and outgoing ports must be different. The application can also ensure that only packets coming from a specified source are being retransmitted. While the latter doesnâ€™t provide any real security since it is trivial to spoof the source IP address, it does provide some immunity from other applications.


```
Usage:
  uc2bc [options]

Options:
  --listen-port -i [port]       # The port to listen for incoming packets on
  --broadcast-address -b [addr] # The local broadcast address
  --broadcast-port -o [port]    # The port to use for outgoing packets
  --source-address -s [addr]    # The source for authorised packets

Example:
  uc2bc -i 5000 -b 192.168.0.255 -o 5001
  
```

## Compile

```
gcc -o uc2bc uc2bc.c
```
